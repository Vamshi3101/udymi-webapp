                <h2>Benefits of OPC registration</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Legal Status</li>
                    <p>The OPC receives a separate legal entity status from the member. The separate legal entity of the OPC gives protection to the single individual who has incorporated it. The liability of the member is limited to his/her shares, and he/she is not personally liable for the loss of the company.  Thus, the creditors can sue the OPC and not the member or director.</p>
                    <li>Easy to obtain funds</li>
                    <p>Since OPC is a private company, it is easy to go for fundraising through venture capitals, angel investors, incubators etc. The Banks and the Financial Institutions prefer to grant loans to a company rather than a proprietorship firm. Thus, it becomes easy to obtain funds.</p>
                    <li>Less compliance's</li>
                    <p>The Companies Act, 2013 provides certain exemptions to the OPC with relation to compliance's. The OPC need not prepare the cash flow statement. The company secretary need not sign the books of accounts and annual returns and be signed only by the director.</p>
                    <li>Easy incorporation</li>
                    <p>It is easy to incorporate OPC as only one member and one nominee is required for its incorporation. The member can be the director also. The minimum authorised capital for incorporating OPC is Rs.1 lakh but there is no minimum paid-up capital requirement. Thus, it is easy to incorporate as compared to the other forms of company.</p>
                    <li>Easy to manage</li>
                    <p>Since a single person can establish and run the OPC, it becomes easy to manage its affairs. It is easy to make decisions, and the decision-making process is quick. The ordinary and special resolutions can be passed by the member easily by entering them into the minute book and signed by the sole member. Thus, running and managing the company is easy as there won't be any conflict or delay within the company.</p>
                    <li>Perpetual succession</li>
                    <p>The OPC has the feature of perpetual succession even when there is only one member. While incorporating the OPC, the single-member needs to appoint a nominee. Upon the member's death, the nominee will run the company in the member's place. </p>
